# Very Woof Wallet

We're currently working on making the Very Woof Wallet an official extension for Mozilla Firefox. It might take a while, so in the meantime, we offer a locally installable version of the Very Woof Wallet.

## Local Installation Guide

You can set up this Firefox extension on your system easily by following these steps:

- [Download](https://github.com/verydogelabs/woof-wallet/raw/main/very-woof-wallet.zip) the ZIP archive of the extension and extract it.
- Launch Firefox.
- Open a new tab and enter `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in the address bar.
- Click on the "Load Temporary Add-on..." button.
- Navigate to and select the "manifest.json" file from the extracted "Very Woof Wallet" folder.

This will load the Very Woof Wallet extension to your Firefox browser for local use. Please note that this is a temporary installation, and the extension would need to be reloaded after every restart of the Firefox browser.
